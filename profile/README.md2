## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Learning modules (8 courses)

The organization provides **8 structured learning modules** for digital design and verification. Follow them in order: prerequisites → design → language → testbenches → verification planning → UVM (SystemVerilog, then Python) → a protocol case study.

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [learn_unix_git](https://github.com/universal-verification-methodology/learn_unix_git) | Unix, Git, and tooling basics for digital design and verification courses. |
| [learn_digital_verilog](https://github.com/universal-verification-methodology/learn_digital_verilog) | Digital design with Verilog and SystemVerilog: logic, RTL, state machines, memory, and advanced techniques. |
| [learn_verilog_systemverilog](https://github.com/universal-verification-methodology/learn_verilog_systemverilog) | Version-centric path for Verilog and SystemVerilog (IEEE 1364-1995 through IEEE 1800-2017): what each standard adds and how to migrate. |
| [learn_verilator_iverilog](https://github.com/universal-verification-methodology/learn_verilator_iverilog) | RTL testbenches using Verilog, SystemVerilog, iverilog, and Verilator (Verilog and C++ testbench flows). |
| [verification_planning_management](https://github.com/universal-verification-methodology/verification_planning_management) | Self-paced course on verification planning and management with SystemVerilog/UVM—learn what to verify and how to plan before implementing testbenches. |
| [learn_uvm2017_sv_verilator](https://github.com/universal-verification-methodology/learn_uvm2017_sv_verilator) | UVM in SystemVerilog (IEEE 1800.2-2017) with Verilator—examples and testbenches. |
| [learn_uvm_pyuvm](https://github.com/universal-verification-methodology/learn_uvm_pyuvm) | UVM and pyuvm (Python UVM): modular learning path with examples and testbenches. |
| [learn_uart_spi_i2c](https://github.com/universal-verification-methodology/learn_uart_spi_i2c) | **Case study:** UART, SPI, and I²C—specification, RTL, and UVM-based verification with Verilator (apply the full flow end-to-end). |
